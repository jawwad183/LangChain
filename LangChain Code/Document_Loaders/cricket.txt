Cricket originated in England during the 16th century, evolving from childrenâ€™s bat-and-ball games. By the 17th century, it became a popular sport among adults, especially in the southeast of England. The first official rules were codified in the 18th century, and the sport spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire.

The 19th century saw the establishment of county clubs and the birth of international cricket, with the first Test match played between England and Australia in 1877. The introduction of limited-overs cricket in the 20th century, including One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20), revolutionized the game, making it faster and more spectator-friendly.

Today, cricket is played worldwide with major tournaments like the Cricket World Cup and the T20 World Cup, and is particularly popular in countries like India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa. The sport continues to evolve, blending tradition with modern innovation.
